# Stats-220
*My name is Fusipongi Manuhaapai and this is my second Stats 220 repository.*

**This is my second time taking Stats 220. As I said at my other repository, that I will mostly be using this for my assignments in Stats 220.**

**If you are taking Stats 220 as well and wants to help each other with this course then:**

* follow me [fma1706](github.com).

* check out my attempt for project 1 [stats220](https://fma1706.github.io/stats-220/)

*You won't find anything fancy here but just my work for Stats 220.*
